# Forest-Cover-Project
You are provided with 50000 labeled training data, and 100000 of test data, which are not labeled. The goal is to develop a multi-class classifier that predicts the labels for the test data set. There are 54 features - 10 quantitative variables and 44 binary variables. For more detailed description of the dataset and the variables see the description at the UCI repository.

## Languages and Skills:
* Python: numpy, pandas, sklearn libraries.Visualizations: matplotlib and seaborn (histograms, facet plots, boxplots) 
* Normalization and scaling across several variables
* Outlier detection and removal
* Ensembling: original accuracy ranged from 10% to 54% across 5 different models.
